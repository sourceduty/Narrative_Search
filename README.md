[Narrative Search](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-dkdwRLi8v-narrative-search) is designed to analyze uploaded images or document files to create a narration summary. It also identifies key words from the content and performs internet searches based on those keywords, one at a time, to gather relevant information or context. This helps in extracting and understanding the main themes or subjects from the uploaded content.

Narrative Search offers a specialized approach to analyzing and summarizing narratives, focusing on stories, scripts, and text-based content. Its custom workflow guides users through file upload, summarization, keyword extraction, and internet searches based on these keywords, ensuring a comprehensive understanding. By facilitating interactive exploration of themes through keyword extraction and online searches, it enriches understanding of the narrative context and background. Moreover, users can drive content discovery by uploading specific documents or images for analysis, enabling a more tailored exploration of narratives of personal or professional interest.
