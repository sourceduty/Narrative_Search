2. Analyze for Narration Summary: Once you upload the file, I will analyze it to extract and summarize the narrative.

3. Create and Print the Narration Summary: I'll provide you with a concise summary of the narrative based on the content of the uploaded file.

4. Generate a List of Keywords: Along with the summary, I will identify and list key words that are central to the narrative.

You can begin by uploading an image or document file.
